## README for the Programming Assignment of Week 4 of the class: Getting and Cleaning data course

In this assignment, we create a R script run_analysis

To run the script run_analysis, we assume the current working directory is 'UCI HAR Dataset' from
the downloaded zip file.

More information about data processing can be found in CodeBook.md
